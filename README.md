# Data_Science_Uni_Projects

 Two sets of exercises which implement Data Science/Machine Learning methods for clustering, recommendation systems, rating predictions etc. These were university assignments on a Data Mining course. The data we practice on comes from the Yelp Academic Dataset : https://www.yelp.com/dataset. The assignment questions have been included in a pdf. For each coding exercise I have included a jupyter notebook plus a report which comments on the results. The required data files from Yelp have not been included in the repository due to their huge size, but I will list everything that is needed below, so you can download it from Yelp if you wish to test/use the code. Please note that the reports have been written in Greek, as have some explanations in the notebook files. This will change in the future. I hope nothing else in this repository seems Greek to you, though!

For SET2, you will need:

yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
yelp_academic_dataset_review.json

For SET3, you will need:

yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
yelp_academic_dataset_user.json
